    <h1>A Comprehensive Guide to Seattle, WA</h1>
    <h2 class="italics">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Growing up in Seattle has played an influential role in my adolescent development. It taught me to seek refuge and release in the outdoors, whether that is
    hiking, playing sports, or simply just listening to the natural sounds in the woods. With such a strong city sports culture, I learned to love football, soccer, baseball, and many other sports.
    In addition, the music scene has also been equally inspiring. With legendary artists like <em>Jimmy Hendrix</em> hailing from this city, as well as modern day rappers like <em>Lil Mosey</em>, I've learned that
    Seattle's music taste is as diverse as its people. Seattle is known for its technology scene as well, with companies like Amazon, Starbucks, Microsoft, and Boeing all beginning in this rainy city.
    If you can get over the rain, Seattle is the best place to be. And if you're ever in town, the comprehensive guide below should give you a good idea of where to start exploring. Hope you enjoy!

      <p><b>Background:</b> Mount Rainier is the highest mountain in the Cascade Range, located 59 miles south of Seattle, WA in Mount Rainier National Park. It is technically classified as a large stratovolcano that is active.
      It is home to some of the most scenic glaciers known to man, and is topped by two volcanic craters. The most recent recorded volcanic eruption was between 1820 and 1854, but many eyewitnesses reported eruptive activity in 1858, 1870, 1879, 1882, and 1894 as well.
      It's definitely worth visiting but stay safe!

      <p><b>Background:</b> Contrary to popular belief, the Space Needle is actually not the tallest buildling in Seattle. The Colombia Center, formerly known as the Bank of America Tower, is a skyscraper that is 76-stories tall.
        It reaches a height of 933 ft, and when it was first built, it was the tallest buildling in the West Coast. As of 2017, it is the fourth tallest
        building in the West Coast. But this building still has the tallest observatory/viewing deck West of the Mississippi and provides a great view of the entire city.

        The stairwell shaft is covered by a four-story "living wall" with 25,000 plants, including carnivorous species from Asia. The spheres have 40,000 plants from 50 countries and are divided into three areas, with the western and eastern domes segregated into the Old World and New World.
